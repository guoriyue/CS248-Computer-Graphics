# SIMD Ray Tracing + Multi-Spectral Rendering

Boyu Zhang bzhang99@stanford.edu

Mingfei Guo mfguo@stanford.edu

Summary:

<<<<<<< HEAD
We are interested in different topics. Mingfei wants to improve the current BVH using SIMD, and Boyu wants to implement the multi-spectral rendering. In the end, we should be able to render images faster and render prism-like effects.

Task list:
