# SIMD Ray Tracing + Multi-Spectral Rendering

Boyu Zhang bzhang99@stanford.edu

Mingfei Guo mfguo@stanford.edu

Summary:

We are interested in different topics. Mingfei wants to improve the current BVH using SIMD, and Boyu wants to implement the multi-spectral rendering. In the end, we should be able to render images faster and render prism-like effects.

Task list:

Mingfei guo:

Improve current BVH using SIMD.

Boyu Zhang:

Implement multi-spectral rendering for prism-like effects.
